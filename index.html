title: Pace Front-End Coding Guidelines
---

<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>As our team grows and code passes through many hands, we ought to come to an agreement of general guidelines to follow for front-end development.</p>
<p>As with any 'guidelines' these are not meant to be absolute truths, but breaking them must be intentional and with good reason.</p>

<h1>Discussion points:</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Indentation preferences</li>
  <li>Front-end tooling preferences (frameworks, CLI tools)</li>
  <li>CSS naming conventions</li>
  <li>CSS file structure</li>
</ul>
